#Create a RESTful API that allows a consuming client application the ability to:

- Add an item
- Retrieve an item
- List a collection of items.

All Items must be stored in a CouchDB database.  

Track the following data for each item:

- Name
- Description
- In Stock?
- Retail Cost
- Date Available

You will need to tag and commit your work by 2:00 p.m. When you are ready to turn in your work, do the following
- Using Git, tag your work as “v1.0”.  Example: `$ git tag v1.0`
- Commit and push to a GitHub repo named “api-exam”
- Send a direct slack message to Tom and Trip containing:
   - a url to your GitHub repository  
   - a listing of HTTP Verbs and API endpoints:  Ex:  GET http://localhost:3000/cats

To test your work, we will fork and clone your repo, attempt to start your node application, and call your endpoints using POSTman or cURL.  

*Grading*
Your work will be graded on the following scale:

- Incomplete
- Does not meet expectations
- Meets expectations
- Exceeds expectations

Your work must fulfill the minimum requirements without any errors to receive a grade of “Meets expectations”.  Students whose work does not fulfill the minimum requirements will not receive a passing grade.  Students who successfully go beyond the minimum requirements will be considered for a grade of “Exceeds expectations”.  “Meets expectations” and “Exceeds expectations” are considered passing grades.  

You have from 9:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. to complete the project.  

*Recommendations*

- Start with a planning session.  Design your paths, DAL functions, JSON documents, and GitHub repo.
- Create a project list of to do items. Schedule your project list.
- At 1:00 p.m., start preparing your work for release.
- Before 2:00 p.m., commit, tag, and push your work to your GitHub repo.

Best of luck.
